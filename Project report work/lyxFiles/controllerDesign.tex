\[
Ixx\ddot{(yaw)}=Tdx-Tcx
\]

\[
Iyy\ddot{(roll)}=Tdy-Tcy
\]

\[
Izz\ddot{(pitch)}=Tdz-Tcz
\]

Gravity gradient torque is not included here because it is already
included in the disturbance torque for design. 
\[
Tcx=Kp*e+Kd*\dfrac{de}{dt}+Ki*\int edt
\]

Converting the equations to Transfer function form, we get,

\[
e(s)=\frac{Tdx-Ixx*(yaw_{setpoint})*S^{2}}{Ixx*s^{2}+Kd*S+Kp+\frac{Ki}{s}}
\]

Equations for other axes will be similar only.

\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed controller should work for $Tdx=2*10^{-3}$,$Tdy=10^{-4}$,
$Tdz=2*10^{-3}$Nm
\item Steady state error<0.005deg
\item Max overshoot=5\%
\item Settling time(2\%) taken for design=500 secs
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Gain selection:}

Formulas are derived will be same for all axes. Just moment of inertia
term will change

\textbf{Routh Criterion:}

\[
CE=IxxS^{3}+KdS^{2}+KpS+Ki=0
\]

This gives the following conditions.

\[
Ki>0
\]

\[
Kd>0
\]

\[
Ki<\frac{Kd*Kp}{Ixx}
\]

Since Ki has a destabilizing effect, we will take $Ki=Kd*Kp/Ixx$
for design

\textbf{Steady State Error Criterion:}

\[
E_{steady}=lim_{s->0}S*TF*1/S=0
\]

Because of integral term!!

\textbf{Settling time Criterion:}

Since Ki value is going to be small(Since Ixx is large). We can neglect
it here.

\[
2\zeta\omega_{n}=Kd/Ixx
\]

\[
\frac{4.4}{\zeta\omega_{n}}=Ts
\]

This gives us,\textbf{
\[
Kd=\frac{2*4.4*Ixx}{Ts}
\]
}

\textbf{Max overshoot Criterion:}

\[
e^{-\frac{\pi\zeta}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^{2}}}}=\frac{5}{100}
\]

\[
Kp>\frac{Ixx*(4.4)^{2}}{\zeta^{2}Ts^{2}}
\]

Thereby we got 3 formulas to calculate Kp, Ki and Kd gains. Kp given
by this inequality is very low. So Kp=1 is taken as a conservative
value. However KD and Ki are fixed as per the formulas found.
